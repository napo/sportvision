This project focuses on designing and implementing a web application for analyzing volleyball match and training videos, aimed at helping coaches and athletes improve performance and tactics. It addresses the lack of user-friendly video analysis tools for amateur users, as existing solutions are often complex and tailored for professional teams. Inspired by the Sport4.0 concept, the app was developed with a user-centric approach. 

The entire initiative stems from the thesis work of Andrea Richichi
